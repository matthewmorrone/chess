# Javascript Chess

I built this Chess Interface and AI using the [chess.js chess library](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) from [jhlywa](https://github.com/jhlywa).

The AI uses AlphaBeta algorithm which is a shortcut version of minmax.  It has a terrible board scoring function and is incredibly slow due to the string based chess.js chess engine.

Read more about it on [my blog](http://thingsilearned.com/2012/11/22/javascript-chess-game/) or [try it out here](http://thingsilearned.com/projects/chess/).

This project is free as in beer.
