# Javascript Chess

I built this Chess Interface and AI pretty much from scratch.

The interface is complete, but the AI is lacking the I for now (it keeps trying to castle itself out of check).

## todo
+ implement endgame rules and reset
+ figure out why the depth search sucks so bad
+ remove animation stall
